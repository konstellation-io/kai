# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), which are documents that capture important decisions made during the project's development, particularly those that affect the architecture and design of the system. Each ADR provides a concise summary of the decision, its rationale, and any trade-offs or implications that were considered.

You can use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for managing the ADR files.
