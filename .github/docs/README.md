- `technical_specifications`: This folder contains documentation about the technical aspects of the project. It may include detailed specifications for the API, database schema, network architecture, or other technical components of the system.

- `user_guides`: This folder contains documentation intended for end-users of the system. It may include user manuals, installation guides, troubleshooting tips, or other information that helps users understand and use the system effectively.

- `adr`: This folder contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), which are documents that capture important decisions made during the project's development, particularly those that affect the architecture and design of the system. Each ADR provides a concise summary of the decision, its rationale, and any trade-offs or implications that were considered.
