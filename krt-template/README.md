# KRT-TEMPLATE

## Generate KRT

```
$ ./generate_krts.sh
```

This will generate the KRT file inside the `build` folder.

## Entrypoint development

TODO: Find out a better way to develop this with autogenerated code.

## Call to entrypoint

Call to `run_test.sh <runtime-name> <version-name>` to call a gRPC endpoint. 

Example: Given you have a Runtime named "test" and you upload a krt for version "greeter-v1", run this command:

```sh
./run_test.sh test greeter-v1
```
